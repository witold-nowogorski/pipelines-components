Welcome to the official Kubeflow Pipelines Components repository! This is the centralized hub for reusable
components and pipelines within the Kubeflow ecosystem, providing a structured collection of AI workflow building
blocks for Kubernetes.

## 🎯 Purpose

The Kubeflow Pipelines Components repository serves as:

- **Centralized Asset Library**: A dedicated space for hosting reusable components and pipelines, promoting
  consistency and ease of access across the Kubeflow ecosystem
- **Standardized Documentation Hub**: Ensuring each component and pipeline includes comprehensive documentation and
  metadata for better discoverability and usability
- **Community Collaboration Platform**: Providing clear guidelines and governance to encourage contributions from the
  community
- **Automated Quality Assurance**: Implementing automated testing and maintenance processes to ensure reliability and
  up-to-date status of all assets

### Component Categories

- **Training**: Components for model training, hyperparameter tuning, and optimization
- **Evaluation**: Model evaluation, metrics calculation, and performance analysis
- **Data Processing**: Data preparation, transformation, and feature engineering
- **Deployment**: Model serving, endpoint management, and production deployment

## 🚀 Installation

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**: This repository is currently under development. The packages described below are not yet
> available on PyPI. This section outlines the planned installation process for when the packages are released.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later
- Kubeflow Pipelines SDK

### Install Components (Coming Soon)

Install the official Kubeflow SDK with components:

```bash
# Not yet available - coming soon!
pip install kubeflow
```

### Verify Installation

Once the packages are available, you'll be able to verify the installation:

```python
# Coming soon - example verification code
from kfp_components.components import training, evaluation, data_processing

# Example: Use a training component
from kfp_components.components.training import my_component

# List available components
print(dir(training))
```

## 💻 Usage

### Using Components in Your Pipeline

```python
from kfp import dsl
from kfp_components.components.training import model_trainer
from kfp_components.components.evaluation import model_evaluator

@dsl.pipeline(
    name="my-ai-pipeline",
    description="Example pipeline using KFP components"
)
def my_pipeline(
    dataset_path: str,
    model_name: str
):
    # Train model using a reusable component
    training_task = model_trainer(
        dataset=dataset_path,
        model_name=model_name
    )
    
    # Evaluate the trained model
    evaluation_task = model_evaluator(
        model=training_task.outputs["model"],
        test_dataset=dataset_path
    )
```

### Component Metadata

Each component includes standardized metadata:

- **Stability**: `alpha`, `beta`, or `stable`
- **Dependencies**: Kubeflow and external service requirements
- **Last Verified**: Date of last verification
- **Documentation**: Links to detailed documentation

## 📚 Documentation

### Core Documentation

- [Component Specification](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/concepts/component/): Detailed
  information on component structure and definition
- [Creating Components](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/user-guides/components/): Guidelines for
  authoring new components
- [Pipeline Concepts](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/concepts/pipeline/): Overview of pipelines in
  Kubeflow

### Repository Documentation

- [Onboarding Guide](docs/ONBOARDING.md): Getting started for new contributors
- [Contributing Guidelines](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md): How to contribute components and pipelines
- [Best Practices](docs/BESTPRACTICES.md): Component authoring best practices
- [Governance](docs/GOVERNANCE.md): Repository governance and ownership model
- [Agent Guidelines](docs/AGENTS.md): Guidance for code-generation agents

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! To contribute:

1. **Review Guidelines**: Read our [Contributing Guidelines](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. **Follow Standards**: Ensure your component includes:
   - `component.py` or `pipeline.py` - The implementation
   - `metadata.yaml` - Standardized metadata
   - `README.md` - Component documentation
   - `OWNERS` - Maintainer information
   - `tests/` - Unit tests
   - `example_pipelines.py` - Usage examples
3. **Submit PR**: Open a pull request with your contribution

### Quality Standards

All contributions must:

- Pass linting and formatting checks (Black, pydocstyle)
- Include comprehensive docstrings
- Compile successfully with `kfp.compiler`
- Include metadata with fresh `lastVerified` date
- Pass automated CI/CD checks

## 📦 Custom Base Images

Components can use custom base images with pre-installed dependencies. These images are
automatically built and pushed to `ghcr.io/kubeflow/pipelines-components-<name>`.

See [Contributing Guidelines](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-custom-base-image) for instructions on
adding new base images, and [`docs/examples/Containerfile`](docs/examples/Containerfile) for a complete
example.

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Automated Maintenance

The repository includes automated maintenance processes:

- **Verification Reminders**: Components are flagged when `lastVerified` is older than 9 months
- **Dependency Updates**: Dependabot monitors and suggests dependency updates
- **Security Scanning**: Critical CVEs trigger automated remediation PRs
- **Removal Process**: Components not verified within 12 months are proposed for removal

### Component Ownership

Each component has designated owners listed in its `OWNERS` file who:

- Review and approve changes
- Update metadata and verification status
- Manage component lifecycle
- Respond to issues and questions

## 📦 Releases

- **Core Package**: `kubeflow` - Official Kubeflow SDK including community-maintained components
- **Versioning**: Follows semantic versioning aligned with Kubeflow releases
- **Release Cadence**: Regular releases aligned with Kubeflow Pipelines SDK
