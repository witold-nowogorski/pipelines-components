    """AutoGluon Tabular Training Pipeline.

    This pipeline implements an efficient two-stage training approach for AutoGluon tabular models
    that balances computational cost with model quality. The pipeline automates the complete
    machine learning workflow from data loading to final model evaluation.

    **Storage strategy:**

    Training datasets are stored on a PVC workspace (not S3 artifacts) so that all
    pipeline steps sharing the workspace can access them without extra downloads. Only
    the test dataset is written to an S3 artifact (for use by the leaderboard evaluation
    component). The workspace is provisioned via ``PipelineConfig.workspace``.

    **Pipeline Stages:**

    1. **Data Loading & Splitting**: Loads tabular (CSV) data from an S3-compatible
       object storage bucket using AWS credentials configured via Kubernetes secrets.
       The component samples the data (up to 1GB), then performs a two-stage split:
       *Primary split** (default 80/20): separates a *test set* (20%, written to an
         S3 artifact) from the *train portion* (80%).
         **Secondary split** (default 30/70 of the train portion): produces
         ``models_selection_train_dataset.csv`` (30%, used for model selection) and
         ``extra_train_dataset.csv`` (70%, passed to ``refit_full`` as extra data).
         Both train CSVs are written to the PVC workspace under
         ``{workspace_path}/datasets/``. For classification tasks the splits are
         stratified by the label column.

    2. **Model Selection**: Trains multiple AutoGluon models on the *selection train*
       data using AutoGluon's ensembling approach (stacking with 3 levels and bagging
       with 2 folds). The component automatically trains various model types including
       neural networks, tree-based models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost), and linear
       models. All models are evaluated on the test set and ranked by performance. The
       top N models are selected for the refitting stage.

    3. **Model Refitting**: Refits each of the top N selected models on the predictor's
       training and validation data, augmented with the *extra train* split via
       ``refit_full(train_data_extra=...)``. This stage runs in parallel (with
       parallelism of 2) to efficiently retrain multiple models. Each refitted model is
       saved with a "_FULL" suffix and optimized for deployment by removing unnecessary
       models and files.

    4. **Leaderboard Evaluation**: Aggregates evaluation results from all refitted model
       artifacts (each refit component writes metrics to model_artifact.path /
       model_name_FULL / metrics). The leaderboard component reads these pre-computed
       metrics and generates an HTML-formatted leaderboard ranking models by their
       performance metrics for comparison and selection.

    **Two-Stage Training Benefits:**

    - **Efficient Exploration:** Initial model training uses a smaller selection-train
      split with efficient ensembling rather than expensive hyperparameter optimization.

    - **Optimal Performance:** Final models are refitted (``refit_full``) on the
      predictor's training and validation data plus the extra-train split, maximizing
      the amount of data seen during the final fit.

    - **Parallel Efficiency:** Top models are refitted in parallel to minimize total
      pipeline execution time.

    - **Production-Ready:** Refitted models are AutoGluon Predictors optimized and ready
      for deployment.

    **AutoGluon Ensembling Approach:**

    The pipeline leverages AutoGluon's unique ensembling strategy that combines multiple
    model types using stacking and bagging rather than traditional hyperparameter optimization.
    This approach is more efficient and typically produces better results for tabular data
    by automatically:

    - Training diverse model families

    - Combining predictions using multi-level stacking

    - Using bootstrap aggregation (bagging) for robustness

    - Selecting optimal ensemble configurations

    Args:
        train_data_secret_name: Kubernetes secret name with S3 credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_S3_ENDPOINT, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION).
        train_data_bucket_name: S3-compatible bucket name containing the tabular data file.
        train_data_file_key: S3 object key of the CSV file (features and target column).
        label_column: Name of the target/label column in the dataset.
        task_type: "binary", "multiclass", or "regression"; drives metrics and model types.
        top_n: Number of top models to select and refit (default: 3); positive integer.

    Returns:
        HTML artifact with leaderboard of refitted models ranked by task_type metric (e.g. accuracy, r2).

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the S3 file cannot be found or accessed.
        ValueError: If label_column missing, task_type invalid, top_n not positive, or split fails.
        KeyError: If AWS credentials missing in secret or required component outputs unavailable.
